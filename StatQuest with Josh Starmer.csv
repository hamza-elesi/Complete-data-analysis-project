Qf06XDYXCXI,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Word Embedding in PyTorch + Lightning,"Word embedding is the first step in lots of neural networks, including Transformers (like ChatGPT) and other state of the models. Here we learn how to code a stand alone word embedding network from scratch and with nn.Linear. We then learn how to load and use pre-trained word embedding values with nn.Embedding.

Long Short-Term Memory is a type of recurrent neural network that can handle much larger sequences of data without those pesky exploding/vanishing gradient problems that plague basic recurrent neural networks.

As a result, we have translate them into some sort of numerical value. The most common practice is to use something called One-Hot-Encoding, which is fine if you don't have many options for each category. However, if you have a lot of options, things get out of hand quickly. This is where methods like Target Encoding really start to shine, so that's what we'll talk about today.

Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

It provides us an easy way to get a sense of what might happen if we could repeat an experiment a bunch of times. It turns point estimates into distributions that can be used to calculate all kinds of stuff, including standard errors, confidence intervals and even p-values. In this video, we show how it can be used to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals. In Part 2, we'll see how to calculate p-values.

OSPr6G6Ka-U,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Expected Values for Continuous Variables!!!,"If you ever muck around in statistics, it's not long before you see E(x) = something. These are expected values. Expected Values for Continuous Variables are a little trickier than their discrete counterparts because we have to do some calculus. However, I'll walk you through it, one step at a time, so don't sweat it! BAM!

NOTE: This one is, believe it or not, pretty near to my heart. When I was taking Statistical Theory in graduate school (from Rodger Berger of Casella and Berger, who wrote the standard textbook on statistical theory, ""Statistical Inference"") I remember having a lot of trouble with expected values. They intimidated me for two reasons 1) deriving them seemed like total luck and 2) I never understood, exactly, what the formula for continuous variables meant in a deep way. I could look at the equation and name the parts, but that was all I could do. Anyway, fast forward a few years and here I am, going back to these basics, this time determined to get that ""deep understanding"" I missed before, and, at least for myself, I succeeded. And I hope that means other people will also be able to get a deep understanding of expected values as well.

NOTE: This StatQuest assumes that you are already familiar with the concept of an Expected Value. If not, check out the 'Quest: https://youtu.be/KLs_7b7SKi4

Corrections:

This video walks you through how to create and interpret ROC graphs step-by-step. We then show how the AUC can be used to compare classification methods and, lastly, we talk about what to do when your data isn't as warm and fuzzy as it should be.

This video sets up the problem that Stochastic Gradient Descent solves and then shows how it does it. Along the way, we discuss situations where Stochastic Gradient Descent is most useful, and some cool features that aren't that obvious.

NOTE: There is a small typo at 9:03. The values for the intercept and slope should be the most recent estimates, 0.86 and 0.68, instead of the original random values, 0 and 1.

StWY5QWMXCw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Gradient Boost Part 4 (of 4): Classification Details,"At last, part 4 in our series of videos on Gradient Boost. This time we dive deep into the details of how it is used for classification, going through algorithm, and the math behind it, one step at a time. Specifically, we derive the loss function from the log(likelihood) of the data and we derive the functions used to calculate the output values from the leaves in each tree. This one is long, but well worth if you want to know how Gradient Boost works.

NOTE: There is a minor error at 7:01. It should just say log(p) - log(1-p) = log(p/(1-p)). And at 19:10 I forgot to put ""L"" in front of some of the loss functions. However, it should be clear what they are since I point to them say, ""This is the loss function"".

The Wikipedia article on Gradient Boosting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting
NOTE: The key to understanding how the wikipedia article relates to this video is to keep reading past the ""pseudo algorithm"" section. The very next section in the article called ""Gradient Tree Boosting"" shows how the algorithm works for trees (which is pretty much the only weak learner people ever use for gradient boost, which is why I focus on it in the video). In that section, you see how the equation is modified so that each leaf from a tree can have a different output value, rather than the entire ""weak learner"" having a single output value - and this is the exact same equation that I use in the video.
Later in the article, in the section called ""Shrinkage"", they show how the learning rate can be included. Since this is also pretty much always used with gradient boost, I simply included it in the base algorithm that I describe.

15:47. It should be R_jm, not R_ij. 
16:18, the leaf in the script is R_1,2 and it should be R_2,1.
21:08. With regression trees, the sample will only go to a single leaf, and this summation simply isolates the one output value of interest from all of the others. However, when I first made this video I was thinking that because Gradient Boost is supposed to work with any ""weak learner"", not just small regression trees, that this summation was a way to add flexibility to the algorithm.
24:15, the header for the residual column should be r_i,2.

Specifically, I was thinking about Swift's line in the last chorus, ""Say you'll remember me even if it's just pretend"". I thought to myself, ""what if I wrote a song about some guy who's 'pretending'?"", and the thought made me laugh out loud. So here's my song about ""pretending"".

Dr2aj85tcUI,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,A Drink From The Well,"Song #73.
Here, take this cup have a drink from the well
Then lend me your ear I’ve a story to tell
Not long ago there was a castle and a prince
And a maiden so fair all surrounded by a fence

Inside those walls the gardens grew lush and green
But the walls themselves were a sight so obscene
A head on each post they were a warning to us all
To keep on our side not to question the wall

A knight from our side saw the maiden from afar
(And) he was drawn to the fence like a moth to a star
So he climbed up the wall and made his way across the lawn
But the prince acted fast and stabbed the knight before the dawn

So look over there, you’ll see his head upon a post
And this is what he said before he gave up the ghost
“Alas, sweet revenge won’t be a story I can tell
but I saw the maiden put poison in the well.”

F7Gqjbg3bWI,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Wildest Dreams,"Here's song #72, and the end of another year of songs. Although I write all of the other songs during the year, the last one is always written by someone else. Often the last song is a comical one, but this year I thought I'd keep it simple. I picked a Taylor Swift song because, believe it or not, I saw her perform twice over the summer. Once in Denver, Colorado and once in Atlanta Georgia. Both concerts were a lot of fun. Sort of like a Broadway Musical and a Three Ring Circus all wrapped up into one big bonanza.

Q81RR3yKn30,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 1: Ridge (L2) Regression,"Ridge Regression is a neat little way to ensure you don't overfit your training data - essentially, you are desensitizing your model to the training data. It can also help you solve unsolvable equations, and if that isn't bad to the bone, I don't know what is.

Correction:
4:06 I say that the difference in fits between the training dataset and the testing dataset is called Variance. However, I should have said that the difference is a _consequence_ of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training data set.

OxA6i3iJd7M,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Miss Carolina,"Here's song #68! The song had two sources of inspiration:

#1: A Gillian Welch song called ""Look at Miss Ohio"", that has the lines:

Oh me oh my oh
Look at Miss Ohio
She’s a running around with her rag-top down
She says ""I wanna do right but not right now""

...anyway - I was biking home from work and I was standing at the intersection of Henderson and Rosemary and I thought of that song and I started to sing about ""Miss North Carolina"" as if she were some sort of trouble maker. From there it turned into ""I miss Carolina, when am I gonna head back home"" - a song about a North Carolina exile that wants to come home. So, that was inspiration #1.

#2 Once I had this idea of ""I miss Carolina"", I started to think about all the political rabble rousing that's going on in the state - and this was before the Silent Sam thing happened (a bunch of people knocked over Silent Sam a few weeks ago) - they've got these crazy state constitutional amendments that are coming out of no where that we are supposed to vote on. One of them declares that ""hunting and fishing will be the primary means for managing fish and wildlife populations"". Stupid stuff that seems like old folk trying to make it harder to young folk to get anything done in the state. So then the song went back to ""Miss Carolina"" - she being the true spirit of the state - she's gone and left us all covered in pretty weeds, but still weeds.

NOTE: I specifically used the antiquated term ""Miss"" instead of the more modern ""Ms"" because ""Miss"" is still used for beauty pageants - when the state picks the woman who most embodies the ""spirit"" of the state - she's beautiful, but also smart, caring and determined to change the world for the better. She's the one that's gone and we need her back.

8nm0G-1uJzA,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,"Odds Ratios and Log(Odds Ratios), Clearly Explained!!!","Odds Ratios and Log(Odds Ratios) are like R-Squared - they describe a relationship between two things. And just like R-Squared, you need to determine if this relationship is statistically significant. This StatQuest goes over all these details so that you are ready for any odds ratio and log(odds ratio) situation that you might get yourself into!!!

This StatQuest builds on the concepts covered in...

Corrections:
8:53 I meant to say ""the remaining 198.7 people without the mutated gene"".
14:27 I correctly wrote ""If the tests worked as expected, 5% should have p-values less than 0.05"". That is correct. However, when recording the voiceover, I said ""5% should have p-values less than 0.5"", which is not correct.

pYxNSUDSFH4,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Probability is not Likelihood. Find out why!!!,"NOTE: This video was originally made as a follow up to an overview of Maximum Likelihood https://youtu.be/XepXtl9YKwc . That video provides context that gives this video more meaning.

Here's one of those tricky little things, Probability vs. Likelihood. In common conversation we use these words interchangeably. However, statisticians make a clear distinction that is important to understand if you want to follow their logic. The good news is that they are both super simple. The bad news is that they are easy to get mixed up. The StatQuest gives you visual images that make them both easy to remember so you'll always keep them straight.

Corrections:
3:18 I should have said the same feature (or variable) can be selected multiple times in a tree. Every time we select a subset of features to choose from, we choose from the full list of features, even if we have already used some of those features. Thus, a single feature can appear multiple times in a tree. 
9:28 I say ""square"" when I meant to say ""square root"".

Here are the lyrics:

When I am feeling down
When I am exhausted
When I am at my end (again)
When I have been broken

When I am feeling scared
When I’m full of worries
When I can only doubt (myself)
You come to me
You come to me
You comfort me

When I am overwhelmed
When sadness becomes me
When the simplest of things
Brings me to ruin

A feather in the wind
and life turns to ashes
When the things I love can’t last
You come to me
You come to me
You comfort me

When you are in my arms
Your head on my shoulder (near my heart)
When I feel you close to me
When you ease my burden

When you hold my hand
It feels right for the first time.
When you smile at me
You bring me calm
You bring me calm
You comfort me

okjYjClSjOg,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,"Quantile-Quantile Plots (QQ plots), Clearly Explained!!!","Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots are used to determine if data can be approximated by a statistical distribution. For example, you might collect some data and wonder if it is normally distributed. A QQ plot will help you answer that question. You can also use QQ plots to compare to different datasets that you collected to determine if their distributions are comparable. This video shows you how to do both things.

NOTE: The data in this video are measures of gene expression. If ""gene expression"" doesn't mean anything to you, just imagine that the data represents how tall a bunch of people are, or how much they weigh. Then consider the y-axis to be the height or weight of the people, and the x-axis just represents all of the data you collected on a single day. In this case, all of the data were collected on the same day, so they form a single column.

NEaUSP4YerM,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,"StatQuest: t-SNE, Clearly Explained","t-SNE is a popular method for making an easy to read graph from a complex dataset, but not many people know how it works. Here's the inside scoop. 

Here’s how to create a t-SNE graph in R (this is copied from the help file for Rtsne)…

library(""Rtsne"")
iris_unique &lt;- unique(iris) # Remove duplicates
iris_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(iris_unique[,1:4])
set.seed(42) # Set a seed if you want reproducible results
tsne_out &lt;- Rtsne(iris_matrix) # Run TSNE

# Show the objects in the 2D tsne representation
plot(tsne_out$Y,col=iris_unique$Species)

This StatQuest is based on the original t-SNE manuscript, and it's not super hard to read (especially if you understand the general idea of how it works): https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf

6:17 I should have said that the blue points have twice the density of the purple points. 
7:08 There should be a 0.05 in the denominator, not a 0.5.

Correction:
9:28 I have log(reads for gene X) - log(average for gene X), but it should be: log(reads for gene X) - average(log values for gene for gene X). We are subtracting the geometric mean from each gene measurement. In other words, if you take 'the average of reads' to be the geometric average, it all hangs neatly together.

Correction:
4:15 I say getting 7 oranges and 1 blue is just as rare a getting 7 blues and 1 red. This is incorrect, since there are more blues and oranges in general than there are blues and red. However, the idea that we add up rarer events is correct.

In MS Excel, this means setting ""Tails = 2"" and ""Type = 3"".

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

Papai Noel
He’s the surfing the waves
He’s got his speedo on, and he’s got his shades

He shaved his beard last week
‘Cause it’s just too warm
This is the mid-summer heat
Not a midwinter storm.

We got people singing Noite Feliz
We just finished plugging in our electrical tree

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

When he’s not hanging dez
Papai’s in Greenland
Fezzik’s employed making
presents by hand

Check out the presépio
It’s bad to the bone
You’ve got your amigo secreto
So you’re never alone

The missa do galo was crazy it lasted all night
Let’s eat a feijoada til we see the morning light

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

TCrC8Vdv1_4,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,That's Alright,"That's Alright Performed by The Star Makers. Recorded live on 2015-09-20. 

I see the world the way I want to see the world from over here. 
Everything is clear. 
You see the world the way you want to see the world from over there. 
In your rocking chair. 

So we might fight 
All night 
But that’s alright with me. 

I ride a bike you drive a truck I shake my fist up in the air. 
To let you know I care 
You leave your trash out on the curb for weeks on end it makes me mad. 
I bet that makes you glad 

You stay up late I go to bed I hear the noise right through the wall. 
I give the cops a call. 
I’m up at 5 it’s time for work when the cops arrive and take me in. 
Oh not again! 

I get back home my fingers crossed but I’m not alone you’re still around. 
Sitting on the ground. 
We’ve tried to be apart but there’s nothing’s worse than a lonely heart I guess I see. 
You’re the one for me.

RNA-seq results often contain a PCA or MDS plot. This StatQuest explains how these graphs are generated, how to interpret them, and how to determine if the plot is informative or not.
