NjtwlK4QGEU,Data Science Dojo,Building Intelligent Chatbots | Key Challenges in Building Enterprise LLM Applications,"As enterprises move beyond ChatGPT, Bard, and 'demo applications' of large language models, product leaders, and engineers are running into challenges. The magical experience we observe on content generation and summarization tasks using ChatGPT is not replicated on custom LLM applications built on enterprise data. This frustration can lead to one (or a mix) of the following reactions:

- Enterprise LLMs are yet another hype or fad at best.
- Enterprise LLMs are good only for summarization and content generation tasks; They are not suitable for enterprise applications.
- Building LLM applications is significantly harder than just using an off-the-shelf foundation model.

💼 Learn to build LLM-powered apps in just 40 hours with our Large Language Models bootcamp: https://hubs.la/Q01ZZGL-0


The third point is the closest to reality. Enterprise LLM applications are easy to imagine and build a demo out of, but somewhat challenging to turn into a business application. The complexity of datasets, training costs, cost of token usage, response latency, context limit, fragility of prompts, and repeatability are some of the problems faced during product development.

As the Chief Data Scientist at Data Science Dojo, Raja has led a team of extremely talented data scientists and software engineers to deliver multiple enterprise applications of large language models. In this live talk, Raja will go over the challenges faced by his team while building these mission-critical applications and how the team overcame those challenges.

S5oM_WWjoL4,Data Science Dojo,Build Machine Learning Model from Noisy Labeled Data,"Learn how to build machine learning model from noisy labeled data.  Machine learning model operating in big and small enterprises is often trained on noisy, crowdsourced, or user-generated data. As the annotators are not experts in the application domain or data labelling, ML specialists have to take this property into account when training and operating with the model.

The talk is intended for ML engineers and researchers and will show them how to take into account the specifics of crowdsourced annotations when building or improving their own machine learning model. We will look at three important issues:

• How to properly account for noisy labelled data when training a model
• How to take into account the subjective responses of annotators
• How to track distribution bias using model monitoring

Hy38scZx3bg,Data Science Dojo,Power of Embeddings with Vector Search | Using Unstructured Data | Future of Data & AI,"The total amount of digital data generated worldwide is increasing at a rapid rate. Simultaneously, approximately 80% (and growing) of this newly generated data is unstructured data – data that does not conform to a table- or object-based model.  

Examples of unstructured data include text, images, protein structures, geospatial information, and IoT data streams. Despite this, the vast majority of companies and organizations do not have a way of storing and analyzing these increasingly large quantities of unstructured data. Embeddings – high-dimensional, dense vectors which represent the semantic content of unstructured data – can remedy this.  

💼 Learn to build LLM-powered apps in just 40 hours with our Large Language Models bootcamp: https://hubs.la/Q01ZZGL-0

In this tutorial, we’ll introduce embeddings and vector search from both an ML- and application-level perspective. This talk will include: 

- A high-level overview of embeddings and discuss best practices around embedding generation and usage.  
- Build two systems; semantic text search and reverse image search.  
- See how we can put our application into production using Milvus - the world’s most popular open-source vector database.

1v-Ca9iyo0k,Data Science Dojo,Approaches to Fraud and Anomaly Detection: Autoencoder and Isolation Forest,"An overview of fraud and anomaly detection via Autoencoder and Isolation Forest. 

“Experts estimate federal government losses from potential fraud at nearly $150 billion” and new data shows the Federal Trade Commission received 2.8 million reports of fraud in 2021 from consumers. In this webinar, we liked to show how to fight fraud with KNIME, a free and low-code tool, that can perform fraud and anomaly detection without a single line of code nor brittle if-then rules!

In the first part of this webinar, we will work with labelled data to perform classical machine-learning approaches to fraud detection such as the random forest. Then we will cover a deep learning technique, the autoencoder, to find fraudulent data points.

In the second part of the webinar, we will focus on data without labels of fraudulent activity using visualizations, classical statistics, and machine learning. You will learn how easy it is to generate multiple visualizations, perform statistical analysis, and use two machine learning algorithms - Isolation Forest and DBSCAN - all to detect fraudulent activity in the free, open-source KNIME Analytics Platform.

In this session you will learn:
- How to identify fraud using a variety of techniques including visualizations, statistics, and machine learning 
- How to use machine learning and deep learning algorithms for fraud detection regardless of whether you have labelled data or not

buRkFmE_HjA,Data Science Dojo,Introduction to Graph Analytics and Graph Database,"Here is an overview of graph analytics and graph database. 

According to industry analysts, graph technology will be foundational for 80% of Analytics and ML workloads by 2025. The reason for this explosion in growth is organizations need to ask more and more complex questions of their ever-growing data sets. Furthermore, data science professionals are realizing that the connections, or relationships, that tie their data together are just as important as the data points themselves. With graphs, those relationships can be treated as first-class data citizens – eliminating the need for time-consuming and computationally expensive joins.

In this session, we’ll cover a high-level overview of GraphDB, what makes them different, and what use cases graph technology is optimal for. From there, we’ll dive into the specific use case of fraud detection and run a demo of what a potential graph-based solution could look like. This talk will help you understand how graph analytics is being used today by some of the world’s most innovative organizations.

By the end of the session, you will have an understanding of the following:

- What makes graphs different
- What use cases are a good fit for graphs
- Why graph is a value add to current ML approaches
- How you can begin to leverage graphs today

4NcNYVNUeog,Data Science Dojo,MySQL Tutorial for Beginners,"An overview of MySQL, tools you need to interface with the newly set up RDBMS, and a few datasets that can be used to populate a small testing environment.

While data science has evolved, one fact has remained true even in the fast-paced recent years: most of the structured data remains in various RDBMS engine instances. Therefore, in the real world, most engineers and scientists will have to face the antediluvian SQL and the classic databases and their models behind it. The skills necessary to be a good data scientist include being able to retrieve and work with data, and to do that you need to be well-versed in SQL, the standard language for communicating with database systems.

There are great courses on how to use SQL, but in this presentation, we want to show you how easy it is to set up a playground with a ""real"" MySQL database.

In this presentation, we will discuss the topics:

- Is SQL useful for data science?
- Do a quick overview of what's a relational database management system and how it's different from the perhaps more modern NoSQL databases.
- Touch on SQL a bit, but this is not a SQL-oriented webinar.
- Guide through the ways to set up a local or remote RDBMS environment using MySQL.
- Show the tools you need to interface with the newly set up RDBMS.
- Show a few datasets that can be used to populate a small testing environment.

00:00 Introduction
03:30 What is a relational database management system (RDBMS)
07:50 Is SQL useful for data science

kJeq15LFYU8,Data Science Dojo,Data Wrangling using SQL | What is Data Wrangling?,"Learn how to wrangle data using SQL. Data wrangling is the art of bringing data together and preparing it for analysis. It is often the most time-consuming aspect of an analytics project. A survey of analysts found that almost half of their time is spent wrangling data. Part of the complication is that analysts have several tools and languages at their disposal, making it difficult to understand which one is the right one for their data-wrangling needs.

Though this crash course focuses on data wrangling with SQL, it will build a foundation for transforming data as you develop your analytics skills. It is intended for beginners with little to no prior experience in SQL. By the end of the session, you will know:

- How to query a dataset
- How to join the data
- How to append data
- How to apply a filter to your datasets
- How to create new data fields

spU-oHBTd6o,Data Science Dojo,Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision for Road Safety,"Learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision can help with road safety.

More than 1.35 million people die in road crashes each year. These deaths are avoidable and unnecessary and governments all over the world are resolving to reduce them, through their ""Vision-Zero"" programs. We will take a technology deep-dive into this problem to first show how a lack of technological innovations has failed to lower this trend over the past 20 years. Then we will argue how three enabling trends, 1) video-analytics maturity, 2) availability of powerful edge-computing hardware, and 3) proliferation of CCTV cameras, are poised to change the traffic safety landscape for the better, to reduce fatalities and crashes. 

We will summarize the challenges in this industry, and show how real-time edge-based deep-learning systems, computer vision, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can tackle them effectively by retrofitting existing camera infrastructure for road safety.

7YTeMIq6-9s,Data Science Dojo,Decision Trees Explained | Introduction to Decision Trees,"The decision trees algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms. Just like other supervised learning algorithms, decision trees model relationships, and dependencies between the predictive outputs and the input features. 

As the name suggests, the decision tree algorithm is a tree-structured classifier preferably used to solve classification problems. When a decision tree categorizes data into different classes it is called a classification tree. When it predicts numeric values, it is known as a regression tree. 

Interestingly, decision tree algorithms are used for regression models as well. The same library that you would use to build a classification model, can also be used to build a regression model after changing some of the parameters. We use Attribute Selection Method techniques to simplify the decision-making process and calculate values for every attribute.  

Watch the video to learn in detail about Decision Trees.

cRwB2W1oTvI,Data Science Dojo,Hands-on Introduction to Interpreting Machine Learning Models,"Here is a hands-on introduction to interpreting machine learning models. Interpretable machine learning is needed because machine learning by itself is incomplete as a solution. The complex problems we solve with machine learning can't be solved with traditional software development precisely because we don’t understand all of the problem space we’re trying to solve. By explaining a model’s decisions, we can cover gaps in our understanding of the problem, and increase trust in the products we build with AI.

In this session, we will cover the importance of model interpretation and explain various methods and their classifications, including feature importance, feature summary, and local explanations.

Delve deeper into machine learning, this playlist will discuss all the help you understand including, what is machine learning, what are the types of machine learning, and more: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8eNk_zTBST_stoYSyjMBimtNC3GgxaUA

BPoempNt3s8,Data Science Dojo,What Is a Histogram? | Marketing Analytics for Beginners | Part-35,"An overview of the basics of Histograms and examples of how to use them. It can be incredibly hard to process tons of data gathered which can result from user polls, market research, insights, pricing analytics, surveys, and ratings. Data visualizations can help explore the voluminous data and then make the decision to treat it accurately.  

This video talks about one of the methods to represent numerical data via histograms. A histogram is a graph that shows the frequency of different categories in numerical data. Also, we use the hist function from Matplotlib to plot a histogram. Two parameters that are required are the dataset, that is the ages of employees in our case, and the number of bins. There are other optional parameters in the histogram too to adjust the characteristics of our graph. 

Table of Contents:
0:00 – Introduction to the histogram 
0:28 – Representing numerical data with histogram 
0:53 – Example to use a histogram 
1:32 – Number of bins in a histogram 
2:12 – Implementing histogram in Python

h8XZ8kc6uqo,Data Science Dojo,Introduction to Hierarchical Clustering | Hierarchical Clustering with College Scorecard Data,"Learn what is hierarchical clustering and how it can help to build clusters from the ground up. Clustering is an unsupervised machine-learning technique where data need not be labeled. The goal of clustering is to find like-items such as similar customers, similar products, or similar students, just to name a few. Popular clustering algorithms include K-means and hierarchical clustering, as well as DBSCAN, PAM, and more.


In this session, participants will learn how hierarchical clustering methods build clusters from the ground up. The benefits of a hierarchical clustering approach will be shared, and a few disadvantages will be covered. Our example use case focuses on using The College Scorecard data to cluster similar schools together based on various demographic and institution characteristics – to help students identify similar schools when they are exploring their multiple options.

DHG8F3UxVhs,Data Science Dojo,What is Retargeting | Marketing Analytics for Beginners | Part-28,"In marketing analytics, retargeting is how companies re-engage potential customers. Companies use Google Analytics or tracking codes to identify a criterion that can be used to develop retargeting lists. These lists identify people who had a buying intention when they visited the platform but were disturbed or distracted. Once this is done, marketing teams approach these people through different mediums that intend to bring them back to the buying platform.  

This video gives an example of how Amazon uses retargeting to bring potential customers back to their buying platform. Furthermore, it discusses different stages in the customer journey and the appropriate tools that can be used to develop retargeting lists. We answer questions such as: What is retargeting? How does Amazon use retargeting? What tools can be used to gather insights for retargeting? How can marketing teams use retargeting lists to identify customers with a buying intention?

This presentation will show how data practitioners can containerize and share their local machine-learning model with their teammates in a couple of lines of Python code.

After training a model, data scientists might want other members of their team including their manager to try out their model. However, their team members might have different operating systems from them and might be not familiar with their programming language. Thus, it is necessary for data scientists to containerize their models and create an intuitive API endpoint for their teammates to interact with. However, data scientists might not have all the time and skills to do all of the things above. Luckily, BentoML allows data scientists to put their models into production with ease.

d8xGWdPqvfc,Data Science Dojo,R and Python: The best of both worlds,"Learn why the synergy of R and Python is essential for a data scientist and how to get started with these languages. One of the most common data science questions is what language beginners should learn, R or Python. This has led to a rivalry between the two languages, termed the ""Language War"". 

The purpose of this talk is to announce that this rivalry is over, and we are entering a new era. We'll go through the main defining features of both languages (influenced by their history) and how they compare between different workflows in data science (i.e., data visualization, machine learning) and data types (i.e., text, image, or time series). As a final element, I'll show what methods are available for combining both in the same workspace and demonstrate this with a case study. At the end of the talk, you'll be able to appreciate why being bilingual is essential for a modern data scientist and what are the best ways to get started.

Whether you're a seasoned data professional or just starting your journey, this comprehensive guide will equip you with the tools and insights you need. Stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of data science by harnessing the best of both worlds.

X1vxNo9mYMw,Data Science Dojo,Most Important Skills of Data Scientists | Mastering Data Skills with Behavioral Science,"A deep dive into mastering important data skills with behavioral science. Data engineering is the unsung hero of the analytics revolution. While machine learning algorithms get all the spotlight, the quality of data can make or break an analytics project. Missing data or entry errors are just the tip of the iceberg: Thoughtfully creating new variables that are tailor-made for the business problem at hand will pay long-lasting dividends in terms of model accuracy and effectiveness. As Yogi Berra said, ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future"". Predictive analytics assumes ""business as usual"", which really means ""business as before"", and that's an increasingly questionable assumption today. To successfully predict the future requires developing a deeper understanding of what drives people's behavior.

Are you working in marketing or customer analytics? Measuring and increasing lifetime value, reducing churn, and optimizing marketing communication require going beyond correlations to identify the true causes of behavior. So come get your behavioral edge by attending “The Behavioral Edge: Level up your data skills with Behavioral Science” by Florent Buisson

Table of Contents:
00:00 Introduction
01:40 Why behavioral science matters for analytics
03:40 Different types of analytics tell us different things about behaviors
13:00 Behavioral perspective
20:57 Behavioral variables
29:35 Causal analytics drive effective action
37:40 A/B Testing

7oq2pkC7wiE,Data Science Dojo,Introduction to Referrers | Marketing Analytics for Beginners | Part-18,"In Google Analytics, referrers are websites through which web traffic is directed to the targeted platform. User acquisition through external sources is a great way to identify traffic that needs to be targeted. Referrers are also known as recommendations and can help companies improve their reputation score and search engine ranking. 

This video talks about some common ways of increasing referrals on a website. Furthermore, it explains how referral traffic is tracked and how companies can use user data for marketing analytics. We answer questions such as: What are referrers? How can referrers be used to increase brand reputation? How can referrers be used to increase search engine ranking? How to track referral traffic? How does Google Analytics track referral traffic? How can we increase referrers to a website? How to use referral data for marketing strategies?

AF1WZJM_YtY,Data Science Dojo,MLOps Roadmap | MLOps Explained | What is MLOps?,"This tutorial will provide an overview of MLOps. Data scientists at the start of their careers often have the misconception that their job will be largely focused on training and improving models in a Jupyter notebook. The reality is that most data science value is created outside of a notebook. 

This crash course is intended for data scientists with basic knowledge of developing machine learning models in a Jupyter Notebook setting. By the end of the session, you will know:
1. What is MLOps (Machine Learning Operationalization) and why it's necessary.
2. What is a machine learning pipeline.
3. How to create and deploy a fully reproducible MLOps pipeline from scratch.
4. Learn the basics of continuous training, drift detection, alerts, and model deployment.

saCvd-RzBLA,Data Science Dojo,Introduction to Sales Funnel | Marketing Analytics for Beginners | Part-17,"In Google Analytics, a sales funnel is defined as a marketing strategy that is used to convert a prospect into a customer. It is a multi-step process that is applied to a large number of prospects using different lead-nurturing strategies. These strategies range from word of mouth, marketing emails, lead generation strategies, target audience research, and more. Using these marketing strategies, a pool of prospects funnel downwards to become a customer. As each prospect has a different buyer persona, it is important to understand and target each prospect using customized strategies. 

This video talks about how to create an effective sales funnel that encourages the buyer to do their own personal research as they move down the funnel. Furthermore, it discusses some of the strategies used by Netflix to drive people into purchasing their subscriptions. We answer questions such as: What is a sales funnel? How to get someone to enter your sales funnel? What are different kinds of marketing strategies? How to create lead generation tutorials? Who is the right audience? What are their needs and goals? How does your product solve their problem? How does Netflix use a sales funnel to increase customers? How can marketing analytics make use of a sales funnel?

pIs-AeuBVU8,Data Science Dojo,Understanding Data Analytics for Data Driven Decision Making,"Translate your data for effective and data-driven decision-making. As data scientists, we are constantly focused on learning new ML techniques and algorithms.  However, in any company, value is created primarily by making decisions.  In this talk I present a systematic process where ML is an input to improve our ability to make better decisions, thereby taking us closer to the prescriptive ideal.  In a nutshell, this process starts by clearly identifying the KPI or metric that we want to improve (eg. revenue).  This metric itself may not be actionable, so we may have to decompose it into actionable metrics.  Importantly, we then move backward and identify the levers that we can pull to improve these intermediate metrics. Unfortunately, most decisions are made under uncertainty, so we generally don’t know ex-ante the effect that pulling a lever has on our metrics.  This is where ML enters the picture: it allows us to embrace uncertainty in a data-driven way.  The process is all about understanding the relationships between metrics, levers, and underlying uncertainty in a systematic way.

ktMHXoiK7VM,Data Science Dojo,Redis Crash Course for Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning | Redis for Beginners,"A Redis crash course for beginners and its applications for artificial intelligence & machine learning. As data scientists and machine learning professionals make the transition from theory to applied data science, they naturally expand their skill set beyond Python or Pandas.  They need to understand how to leverage a key-value store or database to store their embeddings or features, and how to load and fetch them very quickly for online predictions or to perform complex operations in milliseconds for real-time use cases. Because of that, Redis — the super-fast in-memory database, is being increasingly used for machine learning: from caching, messaging, and fast data ingestion, to vector similarity search and online feature stores. 

This crash course is intended for beginners with no prior experience with Redis. By the end of the session, you will know:

- What a key-value store is, and the difference between Redis and SQL databases
- Which key machine learning concepts and use cases Redis enables 
- Which data types and structures can be stored in Redis
- Key database considerations for deploying real-time AI/ML at scale
- Redis as an online feature store - why and how to get started
- Redis as a vector database for embeddings and neural search - why and how to get started

JexZPxbReE4,Data Science Dojo,Getting High-Quality Data for Computer Vision Models,"Learn how to collect and annotate high-quality data for a computer vision model. Thought leaders in the Artificial Intelligence space such as Andrew Ng have been advocating for a shift from model-centric to data-centric AI. The idea behind this campaign is that AI models can be only marginally improved through tweaks in the algorithm but considerable change can only be achieved by using high-quality data. However, what does ""high-quality data"" mean and how do we go about ensuring the quality, diversity, and consistency of our dataset?

In this talk, we will discuss the practice of collecting and annotating data for your computer vision models and making sure the dataset you are using is representative and free of harmful biases.

About the Presenter:
Iva Gumnishka is the founder and CEO of Humans in the Loop, a professional data collection and annotation company focused on building high-quality datasets for computer vision applications. The company is a social enterprise and its mission is to provide dignified work opportunities to refugees and conflict-affected people through annotation projects. Iva holds a degree in Human Rights from Columbia University and she was named Forbes 30 under 30 in 2018.

CfmR1CI3Srk,Data Science Dojo,Basics of Causal Behavioral Modeling,"Learn the basics of behavioral modeling, online search behaviors, and a neural network representation of discrete models.

There are increasing demands for ""causal ML models"" of the agent behaviors, which enable us to unbox the complex black-box models and make inferences or do proper counterfactual simulations. Many applications (especially in Marketing) intrinsically call for measurement of the causal impact of the product, pricing, and promotion decisions beyond predictions, either from observational data or combinations of experimental and observational data.

Discrete choice modeling of agent behaviors is a generative modeling framework, created by an Economist, Daniel McFadden (Nobel Prize, 2000). This has been a work-horse model in Economics, Marketing Science, and Operation Research. However, this modeling framework is less known to ML/AI researchers outside of Computational Social Science. In this talk, I will introduce discrete choice models of agent behaviors with a focus on consumer demand modeling. I will talk about two different ways of modeling consumer heterogeneity: discrete vs. continuous. In addition, how this individual-level model (i.e. varying parameters at the individual level) can be estimated by using simulated individuals when you only have aggregate sales data is also discussed. A dynamic version of this model is related to reinforcement learning, and I will discuss this linkage. Finally, an extension of this model to consumer online search behaviors and a neural network representation of discrete choice models will be discussed.

Table of Contents:
0:00 – Introduction
3:45 – Introduction to discrete choice model
6:16 – Where we can use it?
12:12 – Key ideas
15:22 – Static discrete choice model

22:08 – Aggregate sales data
26:20 – Consumer sequential search model

2GR5WlWz_pQ,Data Science Dojo,Search Query Expansion using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,"Explore the benefits and customer examples of Search Query Expansion. Enterprise Search for complex technical disciplines remains a major challenge. The tools that work so well in web search - social clues, inbound links, and similar - simply don't exist inside the enterprise. Making it more difficult is the fact that user searches often fail to include synonyms, brand names, and other word variations. Yet traditional approaches - building and maintaining taxonomies or annotating large training sets for machine learning - are costly and don't scale. The Agolo correlation service uses an unsupervised machine learning approach to identify and analyze implicit relationships among terms inside a set of content. The resulting relationship graph can be used for search query expansion and complex search. This discussion will showcase customer examples and explore the benefits of this approach. 

Presenter Bio:

AXCzGIxEswQ,Data Science Dojo,Building Trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Solutions,"Learn how to build Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions and explore the examples of human-AI interaction. As with human-to-human relations, humans and AI solutions work best together when trust exists. To build long-term use of your AI solution, trust needs to be established between the user and the solution. This is not as easy as it sounds, especially since humans can make trust-based decisions in an instant while an AI solution has many factors that can make it untrustworthy. 

In this talk, we’ll explore how concepts used to build trustworthy human relationships can be applied to AI systems. We’ll also discuss guidelines and examples for human-AI interaction, including approaches such as communicating clear intent, interpreting models, providing contextual information, mitigating biases, and more.

hTOQV8aeRWc,Data Science Dojo,Coding Up a Linear Regression Algorithm From Scratch,"Get started with linear regression, this talk will walk through an advanced Python tutorial in which we will be coding up a Linear Regression algorithm from scratch and making it usable in a manner not so different from sci-kit-learn. 

Whether we learn data science through online courses, or tutorials, or jump straight into a hands-on project-based approach, few of us take the time to try and learn how some of our favorite libraries are built. All we know is that we can import the sci-kit-learn library, instantiate a Linear Regression model, and call the “.fit()” method on it. What is happening under the hood? How are these different algorithms implemented in an efficient manner?  

We will be learning about Object-Oriented Programming in Python, vectorized operations, and efficient coding strategies that allow for as much future customization as possible. We will be walking through how to convert mathematical formulas into Python code that runs as efficiently as possible. 

This webinar is not for the Python beginner, you are expected to know basic Data Science tools and frameworks, such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, etc. You are also expected to know, at least in theory, how Linear Regression works. This webinar will bridge that gap between theory and implementation and in the process teach you some advanced Python tips and tricks.

YmC0oQzYSCU,Data Science Dojo,Get started with real-time Data Streaming | What is Data Streaming?,"An overview of data streaming, pros and cons as well as discussing some of the methods developers use to implement real-time solutions, and how users can set up their first stream.

In the modern era, everyone expects their data the second it’s updated. 

Large corporations and Fortune 500 companies depend on this data to be able to predict consumer tastes or estimate where the forces of supply and demand are moving the market. Real-time data is all part of a modern data strategy.

In turn, many companies are working to modify their batch-style data pipelines into real-time data streams. Real-time data streams provide the ability for analysts, machine learning researchers, and data scientists to develop metrics and models that run as soon as new data is created.

This has become a useful solution for companies that manage manufacturing operations, movie streaming, and detect issues in system logging. Real-time analytics are becoming more popular as well as more feasible for companies of all sizes, as the cloud provides various tools that can be quickly implemented.

In this webinar, we will be outlining some of the various real-time database tools and some of their pros and cons as well as discussing some of the methods developers use to implement real-time solutions. Our goal will be to provide those who attend an understanding of data streaming as well as demonstrate how users can set up their first stream.

29woC4IhVzY,Data Science Dojo,"Exploring Gamification, Health Wearables, and Activity","In this talk, Zia Hydari will present his research, investigating gamification, health wearables, and healthy activity.

Health wearables in combination with gamification enable interventions that have the potential to increase physical activity—a key determinant of health. However, the extant literature does not provide conclusive evidence on the benefits of gamification and there are persistent concerns that competition-based gamification approaches will only benefit those who are highly active at the expense of those who are sedentary.

Using a unique dataset of Fitbit wearable users, some of whom participate in a leaderboard, we find that leaderboards lead to a≈370 (3.5%) step increase in the users’ daily physical activity. However, we find that the benefits of leaderboards are highly heterogeneous. Surprisingly, we find that those who were highly active prior to adoption are hurt by leaderboards and walk≈630 fewer steps daily post-adoption (a 5% relative decrease). In contrast, those who were sedentary prior to adoption benefited substantially from leaderboards and walked an additional≈1,300 steps daily after adoption (a 15% relative increase). We find that these effects emerge because sedentary individuals benefit even when leaderboards are small and when they do not rank first on them. In contrast, highly active individuals are harmed by smaller leaderboards and only see the benefit when they rank highly on large leaderboards. We posit that this unexpected divergence in effects could be due to the underappreciated potential of non-competition dynamics (e.g., changes in expectations for exercise) to benefit sedentary users but harm more active ones.

OzMRNVolrKE,Data Science Dojo,What is Azure? | Azure Custom Vision for Beginners,"Azure Custom Vision is an image recognition service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own computer vision models in the cloud. The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze images.

You, the developer, submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then, the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it in your image recognition app to classify new images. You can also export the model itself for offline use.

In this webinar, we will be focusing on familiarizing ourselves with the Azure cloud machine learning ecosystem and the fundamentals of the Azure Custom Vision service. We will learn how to build, train, evaluate, and deploy a custom image recognition model in the cloud, and we will consume the model using Azure’s APIs for our own demo project.

X7cV9S8I9Ic,Data Science Dojo,A Day in The Life of a Data Scientist,"Here is what a day looks like in the life of a data scientist. As more and more organizations implement data-driven processes, the demand for data scientists is growing quickly. But today, there’s no standard definition of what a data scientist is or what they do. On top of that, there’s an emergence of new roles in machine learning engineering, AI research, and data engineering. It’s not always easy to know what to expect when you’re brought in to work with data.

In this webinar, we’ll go over what a typical data scientist’s job looks like. We’ll talk about the day-to-day work, differentiate between the different roles and responsibilities that data scientists have across companies, and describe what a typical day in life looks like.

ayx8B2-QVhk,Data Science Dojo,Manager Revealed How Data Science Bootcamp Helped to Leveraged Data Science at Microsoft,"As the I.T. program manager at Microsoft, Harris Thamby and his team are responsible for the data platform and management for the real estate and security teams. Harris's team took over data recently controlled by external vendors. As they on-boarded the new data, they decided to build a data warehouse to store it. 

With this new data, some of the engineers on the team created some models. As a project manager, Harris wanted to act as a mediator between engineers and his business partners. In order to do that, he needed to get a broader understanding of the possibilities the data could give. This way he could make a case for potential solutions.

He attended our Seattle, October 2019 bootcamp with his team. In 5 days he became more aware of the concepts and tools. He loved how the concepts were joined with examples. With our in-person training, he left with the confidence he needed to make more informed decisions with his data.

jiYwtHYSoQ8,Data Science Dojo,Manager Revealed How Data Science Bootcamp Helped to Leveraged Data Science at Microsoft,"Akshita Garg started at Microsoft about a year ago. Having only been working for an I.T. consulting firm, this was a new industry for her. She decided to join her team of 10 -15 people at our October Seattle bootcamp to learn data science with them. 

She manages the search area at Microsoft, which means she constantly reviews customer sanctification metrics and works with her team to improve or add new features to the search products. 

But the ultimate goal is not to just improve the area she works in but to identify other areas where other project managers could benefit from machine learning in their teams. 

She, at first, thought this bootcamp would only benefit individuals who already understood the basics, but soon realized our hands-on approach made it easy for her to learn. She left confident on how to use and analyze the different models she hopes to implement with her team.

k6pF9hivaOs,Data Science Dojo,Experiment Management for Machine Learning,"Learn about experiment management for machine learning and the typical process that ML practitioners and data scientists follow. An average data scientist (ML Practitioner, AI expert) spends a significant amount of time designing and running experiments (and waiting for them to complete)

This involves one or many of the following:

– trying out various training algorithms
– doing some feature engineering
– changing preprocessing steps to get more homogeneous data
– trying out different types of hyperparameters
– testing data with different datasets

There is a lot that is involved with creating and running experiments, but the only thing that we seem to be equipped to keep track of is the source code of the best-performing experiments and none of the other configuration parameters that actually constitute an experiment.

Because of this, it is quite frequently that we hear phrases like:

“It was working yesterday” – highlighting the commonality in reproducibility of the experiment “I don’t remember what the actual scores are, but using feature X didn’t help” – documentation issue “I fixed a bug, but I ran so many previous experiments with that bug”
– code dependency issue
“I am using the same parameters as experiment 4, why is it not working” – reproducibility and documentation issue

In this talk, I will go through the typical process that ML practitioners and data scientists follow, taking Python and scikit-learn as a use case and the recurring issues that we are starting to see with these processes.

I will describe the best practices to follow to help document experiments to help reproducibility and tools and startups that are working on this space to fix the gaping issues that we have for experiment management.

pERD1Ln_Qh8,Data Science Dojo,What is a Data Engineer?,"In this webinar, we will explore what is a data engineer. This includes discussing what are the goals, skills, and tools that they use on a daily basis. We wanted to take a moment to provide insights into the other options data professionals have besides data scientists.

Data science has attracted a lot of buzz for almost the last decade. The ability to gain insights from data has driven much of the high-tech companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Google's success. However, it is not the only piece of the data puzzle. Quietly, in the background, behind all the models, metrics, and dashboards, another type of data professional has worked to ensure data scientists have the data they need.

These are the data engineers. Data engineers work in the background managing data pipelines and data storage systems to ensure that the rest of the company can get their dashboards, metrics, and models. They use a variety of tools like SQL databases, Hadoop, and Python and are proficient in data modeling and automation.

Ben is a Seattle based Data Scientist & Engineer working in San Francisco, California. He has extensive experience designing ETL pipelines, databases, websites, and other software products for startups and pre-established corporations.

--

In this quick tutorial, we learn that machines can not only make sense of words but also make sense of words in their context. N-grams are one way to help machines understand a word in its context by looking at words in pairs. 

We go over what n-grams are and some examples of how you could use them in natural language processing. By looking at pairs of words, we capture the broader context of words to then train machines to learn these language queues and gain a better understanding of the real meaning of the text.

--

In this quick introduction, we go over the basics of Natural Language Processing, what it is, and a few key applications of it. Machines can’t simply read and interpret language innately like we humans can. So how can machines understand sarcasm, or if a sentence is posed as a question, or even just to find the main topic and re-occurring themes in the words? If you think machines learning from numbers is interesting, then machines learning from words is even more interesting.

NwtxrbqE2Gc,Data Science Dojo,Automated Web Scraping in R using rvest,"How to automatically web scrape periodically so you can analyze timely/frequently updated data.

There are many blogs and tutorials that teach you how to scrape data from a bunch of web pages once and then you’re done. But one-off web scraping is not useful for many applications that require sentiment analysis on recent or timely content, capturing changing events and commentary, or analyzing trends in real-time. As fun as it is to do an academic exercise of web scraping for a one-off analysis of historical data, it is not useful when wanting to use timely or frequently updated data.

Scenario: You would like to tap into news sources to analyze the political events that are changing by the hour and people’s comments on these events. These events could be analyzed to summarize the key discussions and debates in the comments, rate the overall sentiment of the comments, find the key themes in the headlines, see how events and commentary change over time, and more. You need a collection of recent political events or news scraped every hour so that you can analyze these events.

What we’ll do:
We’ll go through the process of writing standard web scraping commands in R, filtering timely data, analyzing or summarizing key information in the text, and sending an email alert of the results of your analysis. We’ll set up our script to run every hour so that text is scraped and analyzed periodically to capture changing events and commentary, or analyze trends in real time. Feel free to bring your laptop and follow along!

SVm3I5pvEB0,Data Science Dojo,AI For Social Good | Responsible AI,"An overview of different social applications of AI and Responsible AI. It's not hard to see machine learning and artificial intelligence in nearly every app we use – from any website we visit to any mobile device we carry, to any goods or services we use. Where there are commercial applications, data scientists are all over it.

What we don't typically see, however, is how AI could be used for social good to tackle real-world issues such as poverty, social and environmental sustainability, access to healthcare and basic needs, and more.

What if we pulled together a group of data scientists working on cutting-edge commercial apps and used their minds to solve some of the world's most difficult social challenges? How much of a difference could one data scientist make let alone many?

In this discussion, Raja Iqbal, Chief Data Scientist and CEO of Data Science Dojo, will walk you through the different social applications of AI and how many real-world problems are beginning to be solved by data scientists.

You will see how some organizations have made a start on tackling some of the biggest problems to date, the kinds of data and approaches they use, and the benefit these applications have made on thousands of people's lives.

You'll learn where there's untapped opportunity in using AI to make impactful change, sparking ideas for your next big project.

NXjPcXx42Yc,Data Science Dojo,Data Visualization with ggplot2 | ggplot2 for Graphs and Plots,"An overview of how ggplot2 can be used for data visualization. The R programming language is experiencing rapid increases in popularity and wide adoption across industries. This popularity is due, in part, to R’s rich and powerful data visualization capabilities. While tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau are often the go-to solutions for data visualizations, none of these tools can compete with R in terms of the sheer breadth of, and control over, crafted data visualizations. 

As an example, R’s ggplot2 package provides the R programmer with dozens of print-quality visualizations – where any visualization can be heavily customized with a minimal amount of code. 

In this webinar, Arham Akheel will provide an introduction to data visualization with the ggplot2 package. The focus of the webinar will be using ggplot2 to analyze your data visually with a specific focus on discovering the underlying signals/patterns of your business. 

Attendees will learn how to: 
• Craft ggplot visualizations, including customization of rendered output. 
• Choose optimal visualizations for the type of data and the nature of the analysis at hand. 
• Leverage ggplot2’s powerful segmentation capabilities to achieve “visual drill-in of data”. 
• Export ggplot2 visualizations from RStudio for use in documents and presentations.

J7UDxm7vVGE,Data Science Dojo,Pearson's Director: Learn How to Create and Use Data Models,"Michael Hernandez had a vision for his team at Pearson Education: “Ensure a customer's success with our products to earn brand loyalty"".  It's relational first, then we align their needs to our solutions based on what is learned, not just what we sell.""  With limited resources, he needed to prove the value of adding the right tools to focus on specific customers who needed the most assistance.

To combine the customer narrative with usage and support patterns for signs of risks, he turned to Data Science Dojo.  Having led customer-facing teams for many years, he knew there were patterns in the customer narrative, but needed to prove which actions would have the most impact on senior leadership. In September 2017 he attended our Data Science & Data Engineering Bootcamp in Austin with self-proclaimed “outdated programming knowledge”, but an eye for what to do with the data models once he could learn how to create them.

After returning to Pearson, the impact was almost immediate. By aligning his vision of “ensuring success first”, he began to create data models outlining risk and opportunity indication campaigns. The collaboration of this data with various teams helped increase the speed and accuracy at which they could provide the right guidance at the right time for the customer’s success.  They tried various implementations using tools such as R, Python, and even Power BI to unleash a proactive support model instead of a historically reactive one.

This new practice brought dramatic growth in customer success for this product line, resulting in a giant leap in customer retention, growth, and revenue.  The impact was felt across the division, leading to a promotion, and putting his team at the front line for expanding this across other digital products.

q78VNmuEsyw,Data Science Dojo,Hands on dplyr Tutorial for Data Manipulation,"Dplyr is a great tool to perform data manipulation. It makes your data analysis process a lot more efficient. Even better, it’s fairly simple to learn and start applying immediately to your work! Oftentimes, with just a few elegant lines of code, your data becomes that much easier to dissect and analyze. For these reasons, it is an essential and foundational skill to master for any aspiring data scientist. Often one may be surprised how some easy-to-learn functions can make the data analysis process that much more efficient. That is certainly the case with dplyr. We will teach you how to use this incredibly useful package to mung data while demonstrating with a Kaggle dataset on wine ratings.

yySoAFaduxY,Data Science Dojo,Using Machine Learning Models Used to Analyze Customer's Data: Eytan Bensoussan's Experience,"Eytan Bensoussan entered our August 2016 Toronto data science bootcamp with a clear goal in mind: untangle the wasted potential of financial data. In the years since, he has founded his own startup company, NorthOne, dedicated to helping small businesses manage their bookkeeping and analyze their finances. Using only a phone app.

Our 5 day course provided the jump start he needed to incorporate data science into all levels of his fledgling company. From the machine learning models used to analyze his customers' data to the methods of communication and data visualization that make that data useful for those investors.

With greater confidence in his data science fundamentals, Eytan has been able to pass that confidence back to his team and the businesses he works with.

fQHlmip1Nwo,Data Science Dojo,Setup and Data Preparation | Introduction to dplyr Part 1,"dplyr is a great tool to perform data manipulation. It makes your data analysis process a lot more efficient. Even better, it's fairly simple to learn and start applying immediately to your work! Oftentimes, with just a few elegant lines of code, your data becomes that much easier to dissect and analyze. For these reasons, it is an essential and foundational skill to master for any aspiring data scientist.

Often one may be surprised how some easy-to-learn functions can make the data analysis process that much more efficient. That is certainly the case with dplyr. In this series, we will teach you how to use this incredibly useful package to mung data, while demonstrating with a Kaggle dataset on wine ratings. 

In Part 1 of this series, we will show you how:
- To obtain the R Programming Language
- Install RStudio 
- Load in the wine ratings dataset from kaggle
- Install ggplot2 and dplyr packages

5vlkVjGLsLc,Data Science Dojo,Building Machine Learning Model from Scratch,"An overview of how to build a machine learning model from scratch. Modern machine learning libraries make model building look deceptively easy. An unnecessary emphasis (admittedly, annoying to the speaker) on tools like R, Python, SparkML, and techniques like deep learning is prevalent. Relying on tools and techniques while ignoring the fundamentals is the wrong approach to model building. 

Real-world machine learning requires hard work, discipline, and rigor. The development of robust models requires due diligence during the data acquisition phase and an obsession with data quality. 

Feature engineering, choice of evaluation metrics, and an understanding of the model bias/variance trade-off are often more important than the choice of tools. Experienced machine learning engineers spend most of their time dealing with data-related issues, model evaluation, and parameter tuning while spending only a fraction of their time in actual model building. This is the 80/20 rule.

Unlike most talks these days, this talk is not about deep learning. We will ignore the hype and strictly focus on the fundamentals of building robust machine learning models.

We ended up using a decision tree algorithm because we have lots of categorical data. We’ll build a very simplistic model so that we can visualize the decision tree model and understand its results.

Before we can feed this dataset into a machine learning model there are two things we have to take care of. First, we have to make sure all the categorical features are treated as categories. We’ll use the editmeta data module once again to cast these features. Then we need to set up a holdout dataset for future evaluation of any model that we build. We will randomly sample our dataset into two partitions, a training set and a test set. The test set we will lock away to pretend that it's future world data. The assumption is if the model we built can predict well on this test set, which it has never been exposed to before, it will do moderately just as well on the future world data.

Let’s understand the aggregate behavior of our features further by looking at summary statistics. Azure Machine Learning gives us easy access to mean, median, mode, min, and max. Let’s look at each measure to see what it means to the interpretation of the data.

The summarize data module also gives us a count for each feature with missing values. We can then formulate a strategy for cleaning missing data. The cleaning functions used in this tutorial are not the optimal way to clean data, but we must learn to crawl before we walk. We’ll drop each row that has a missing value in our response class. Then use one of the measures of central tendency to fill in the other features median for numeric features and mode for categorical features.

49fADBfcDD4,Data Science Dojo,Intro to Data Visualization with R & ggplot2,"In this webinar, we will provide an introduction to data visualization with the ggplot2 package. The focus of the webinar will be using ggplot2 to analyze your data visually with a specific focus on discovering the underlying signals/patterns of your business. 

The R programming language is experiencing rapid increases in popularity and wide adoption across industries. This popularity is due, in part, to R’s rich and powerful data visualization capabilities. While tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau are often the go-to solutions for data visualizations, none of these tools can compete with R in terms of the sheer breadth of, and control over, crafted data visualizations.  

As an example, R’s ggplot2 package provides the R programmer with dozens of print-quality visualizations – where any visualization can be heavily customized with a minimal amount of code. 

In this talk attendees will learn how to: 
• Craft ggplot visualizations, including customization of rendered output. 
• Choose optimal visualizations for the type of data and the nature of the analysis at hand. 
• Leverage ggplot2’s powerful segmentation capabilities to achieve “visual drill-in of data”. 
• Export ggplot2 visualizations from RStudio for use in documents and presentations.

Storytelling is a cornerstone of the human experience. Though many elements of stories have remained the same throughout history, we have developed better tools and mediums for telling them, such as printed books, movies, and comics. 

This has changed storytelling styles—and perhaps most importantly, the impact of those stories. Today the best stories are often interactive, visually compelling, and include rich data. 

Many bloggers, journalists, newspaper columnists, and authors use data to help emphasize their position and engage their audience. In this session, we will learn about telling impactful stories with Power BI.

iO0KpDc0-30,Data Science Dojo,Business Data Analysis with Excel | Master Data Analysis on Excel,"An overview of data analysis with Excel using histograms, running records, and process behavior charts to analyze business data. Business data presents a challenge for the data analyst. Business data is often aggregated, recorded over time, and tends to exhibit autocorrelation. Additionally, and most problematically, the amount of business data is usually quite limited. These characteristics lead to a situation where many of the tools in the analyst's tool belt (e.g., regression) aren't ideal for the task.  Despite these challenges, proper analysis of business data represents a fundamental skill required of Business/Data Analysts, Product/Program Managers, and Data Scientists. At this community talk, we will show how to get started analyzing business data in a robust way using Excel – no programming or statistics required! 

We will cover the following during the presentation:
• The types of business data and why business data is a unique analytical challenge.
• Requirements for robust business data analysis.
• Using histograms, running records, and process behavior charts to analyze business data.
• The rules of trend analysis.
• How to properly compare business data across time, organizations, geographies, etc.Where you can learn more about the tools and techniques.

_KMiEEStB9g,Data Science Dojo,Introduction to Event Log Mining with R,"Event logs are everywhere and represent a prime source of Big Data. Event log sources run the gamut from e-commerce web servers to devices participating in globally distributed Internet of Things (IoT) architectures. Even Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems produce event logs! Given the rich and varied data contained in event logs, mining these assets is a critical skill needed by every Data Scientist, Business/Data Analyst, and Program/Product Manager. At this meetup, presenter Dave Langer, will show how easy it is to get started mining your event logs using the OSS tools of R and ProM. 

Dave will cover the following during the presentation:
• The scenarios and benefits of event log mining
• The minimum data required for event log mining
• Ingesting and analyzing event log data using R
• Process Mining with ProM 
• Event log mining techniques to create features suitable for Machine Learning models
• Where you can learn more about this very handy set of tools and techniques

z4tiH5dKh84,Data Science Dojo,Scale R to Big Data with Hadoop & Spark,"Outline:

R is currently one of the most popular data science languages in the world. However, it’s always had constraints around scaling out to big data. What happens when you expand beyond a couple gigabytes of data? You packed up your data and you used something else; Python, Java, or Mahout to name a few. Now it’s possible to stick with R throughout your production analysis all the way to deployment, regardless of the data size.

Companies like Apache, Revolution Analytics, Microsoft, and H20 showed us this year that distributed computing in R is possible. Today we’ll take a look at what the Microsoft stack is doing in terms of scaling R up to big data.

In this talk we will show you Microsoft R Server, which is a Hadoop or Spark cluster where R is installed on every computer and is equipped with distributed processing libraries to utilize each and every computer in parallel. We’ll show you how to run your normal native R code via SSH, and how to get an RStudio server up and running on the cluster.

We’ll show you how to wrangle data out of an HDFS and build machine learning models from your large dataset. Then show you how to pack up that model and deploy it to an elastically scaled web service so that anyone may call upon it for predictions and insights.

eP3dIlSdOZ0,Data Science Dojo,"Feature Exploration, Visualization, and Predictive Modeling with R and Azure ML","In this 90-minute talk, we will cover an overview of solving a simple predictive analytics problem. We will use R for feature exploration and visualization and build a predictive model using Azure ML.

We will be using the Titanic data set for our exercise. You will see the end-to-end process of building a predictive model. We will start by eyeballing the data set, hypothesizing what features would be useful, exploring and visualizing features. Eventually, we will build predictive models. We will first be using R and then we will use Azure Machine Learning Studio to show how Azure ML speeds up experimentation.
